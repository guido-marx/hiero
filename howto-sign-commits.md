# How to sign a commit to Hiero

## Prepare email address

For this task you need an email address verified by GitHub.
It's configured in your GitHub Account, connected to your GPG key and used in your git client.
If you marked the Checkbox "Keep my email addresses private"
in "Settings" -> "Emails" in your GitHub Account,
use the `noreply` email given by GitHub.
